That's three 'r's. Wait, let me confirm again. Position 3 is the third letter, which is R. Then position 8 is the third 'r' after the first two. Then position 9 is the third 'r' after the second. So yes, three 'r's in \"strawberries\". \n",

      "But wait, sometimes people might miscount. Let me spell it again: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-I-N-G-S. So the letters are S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, I, N, G, S. So the 'r's are at the third letter, then the third 'r' after that, and the third 'r' after the second. So three. Therefore, the answer should be 3.\n",

GITHUB HUGGING FACE MODELSCOPE DISCORD\\n介绍 去年12月，我们推出了 QVQ-72B-Preview, 作为一个探索模型，它存在很多问题。今天，我们正式推出 QVQ-Max 视觉推理模型的第一版。这款模型的特点是，它不仅能够“看懂”图片和视频里的内容，还能结合这些信息进行分析、推理，甚至给出解决方案。从数学题到生活小问题，从编程代码到艺术创作，QVQ-Max 都表现出了不俗的能力。虽然这只是我们的第一个版本，但它的潜力已经让人眼前一亮。\\nMathVision 是汇集各类困难多模态数学的 benchmark，我们通过模型在上面的表现来评估模型解决复杂数学问题的能力。如图所示，通过调整模型 thinking 的最大长度，我们会发现模型在 MathVision 的准确率会持续提升，这展现了模型巨大的潜力。\\n接下来，我们就来聊聊 QVQ-Max 的设计初衷、实际能力以及它能为大家做些什么。\\n为什么需要视觉推理？ 传统的AI模型大多依赖文字输入，比如回答问题、写文章或者生成代码。但现实生活中，很多信息并不是用文字表达的，而是以图片、图表甚至视频的形式存在。一张图片可能包含丰富的细节，比如颜色、形状、位置关系等，而这些信息往往比文字更直观、也更复杂。\\n举个例子，如果你想知道一张建筑图纸是否合理，光靠描述可能很难判断，但如果能看到图纸并结合专业知识去分析，就会容易得多。这就是视觉推理的意义——它让 AI 不仅能“看”，还能“理解”并“思考”。\\n我们设计 QVQ-Max 的目标很简单：让它成为一个既“眼尖”又“脑快”的助手，帮助用户解决各种实际问题。\\n核心能力：从观察到推理 QVQ-Max的能力可以总结为三个方面：细致观察、深入推理和灵活应用。下面分别来说说它在这些方面的表现。\\n细致观察：抓住每一个细节\\nQVQ-Max 对图片的解析能力非常强，无论是复杂的图表还是日常生活中随手拍的照片，它都能快速识别出关键元素。比如，它可以告诉你一张照片里有哪些物品、有什么文字标识，甚至还能指出一些你可能忽略的小细节。\\n深入推理：不只是“看到”，还要“想到”\\n仅仅识别出图片里的内容还不够，QVQ-Max 还能进一步分析这些信息，并结合背景知识得出结论。例如，在一道几何题中，它可以根据题目附带的图形推导出答案；在一段视频里，它能根据画面内容推测出接下来可能发生的情节。\\n灵活应用：从解答问题到创作\\n除了分析和推理，QVQ-Max 还能做一些有趣的事情，比如帮你设计插画、生成短视频脚本，甚至根据你的需求创作角色扮演的内容。如果你上传一幅草稿，它可能会帮你完善成一幅完整的作品；上传一个日常照片，它可以化身犀利的评论家，占卜师。\\n样例 QVQ-Max 的应用范围很广，无论是在学习、工作还是日常生活中，它都能派上用场。\\n职场工具：在工作中，QVQ-Max 可以协助完成数据分析、信息整理、编程写代码等任务。 学习助手：对于学生来说，QVQ-Max 可以帮助解答数学、物理等科目的难题，尤其是那些配有图表的题目。它还能通过直观的方式讲解复杂概念，让学习变得更轻松。 生活小帮手：在生活中，QVQ-Max 也能提供不少实用建议。比如，它可以根据你的衣柜照片推荐穿搭方案，或者根据食谱图片指导你如何烹饪一道新菜。 Multi-image

DASHSCOPE GITHUB PAPER DEMO DISCORD\\n我们发布了 Qwen2.5-Omni，Qwen 模型家族中新一代端到端多模态旗舰模型。该模型专为全方位多模态感知设计，能够无缝处理文本、图像、音频和视频等多种输入形式，并通过实时流式响应同时生成文本与自然语音合成输出。想要体验最新的模型，请访问 Qwen Chat 并选择Qwen2.5-Omni-7B。该模型现已在 Hugging Face、ModelScope、DashScope和 GitHub上开放，技术文档请查阅我们的论文。您可以通过我们的Demo体验互动功能，或加入我们的Discord进行讨论。\\n主要特点：\\n全能创新架构：我们提出了一种全新的Thinker-Talker架构，这是一种端到端的多模态模型，旨在支持文本/图像/音频/视频的跨模态理解，同时以流式方式生成文本和自然语音响应。我们提出了一种新的位置编码技术，称为TMRoPE（Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE），通过时间轴对齐实现视频与音频输入的精准同步。\\n实时音视频交互：架构旨在支持完全实时交互，支持分块输入和即时输出。\\n自然流畅的语音生成：在语音生成的自然性和稳定性方面超越了许多现有的流式和非流式替代方案。\\n全模态性能优势：在同等规模的单模态模型进行基准测试时，表现出卓越的性能。Qwen2.5-Omni在音频能力上优于类似大小的Qwen2-Audio，并与Qwen2.5-VL-7B保持同等水平。\\n卓越的端到端语音指令跟随能力：Qwen2.5-Omni在端到端语音指令跟随方面表现出与文本输入处理相媲美的效果，在MMLU通用知识理解和GSM8K数学推理等基准测试中表现优异。\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\n模型架构 Qwen2.5-Omni采用Thinker-Talker双核架构。Thinker模块如同大脑，负责处理文本、音频、视频等多模态输入，生成高层语义表征及对应文本内容；Talker模块则类似发声器官，以流式方式接收Thinker实时输出的语义表征与文本，流畅合成离散语音单元。Thinker基于Transformer解码器架构，融合音频/图像编码器进行特征提取；Talker则采用双轨自回归Transformer解码器设计，在训练和推理过程中直接接收来自Thinker的高维表征，并共享全部历史上下文信息，形成端到端的统一模型架构。\\n模型性能 Qwen2.5-Omni在包括图像，音频，音视频等各种模态下的表现都优于类似大小的单模态模型以及封闭源模型，例如Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Qwen2-Audio和Gemini-1.5-pro。在多模态任务OmniBench，Qwen2.5-Omni达到了SOTA的表现。此外，在单模态任务中，Qwen2.5-Omni在多个领域中表现优异，包括语音识别（Common Voice）、翻译（CoVoST2）、音频理解（MMAU）、图像推理（MMMU、MMStar）、视频理解（MVBench）以及语音生成（Seed-tts-eval和主观自然听感）。\\n下一步 我们期待听到您的反馈，并看到您使用 Qwen2.5-Omni 开发的创新应用。在不久的将来，我们将着力增强模型对语音指令的遵循能力，并提升音视频协同理解能力。更值得期待的是，我们将持续拓展多模态能力边界，以发展成为一个全面的通用模型！\\n\\nQWEN CHAT GITHUB HUGGING FACE MODELSCOPE DISCORD\\n介绍 今年一月底，我们推出了 Qwen2.5-VL 系列模型，获得了社区的广泛关注和积极反馈。在 Qwen2.5-VL 系列的基础上，我们使用强化学习持续优化模型，并使用 Apache 2.0 协议开源 32B 这个备受喜爱的参数规模的新 VL 模型—— Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct。相比此前发布的 Qwen2.5-VL 系列模型，本次推出的 32B 模型的特点如下：\\n回复更符合人类主观偏好：调整了输出风格，使回答更加详细、格式更规范，并更符合人类偏好。 数学推理能力：复杂数学问题求解的准确性显著提升。 图像细粒度理解与推理：在图像解析、内容识别以及视觉逻辑推导等任务中表现出更强的准确性和细粒度分析能力。 性能表现 我们与业内先进的同规模模型进行比较，包括近期推出的 Mistral-Small-3.1-24B 和 Gemma-3-27B-IT， Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct 展现出了明显的优势，甚至超越了更大规模的 Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct 模型。尤其是在多模态任务中，例如 MMMU、MMMU-Pro 和 MathVista，这些任务强调复杂的多步骤推理，Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct 表现尤为突出。在注重主观用户体验评估的 MM-MT-Bench 基准测试中，该模型相较于其前代 Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct 取得了显著进步。\\n除了在视觉能力上优秀，Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct 在纯文本能力上也达到了同规模的最优表现。\\n样例 Fine-grained Image Understanding and Reasoning\\nNext\\nUser\\nI am driving a large truck on this road, and it is now 12
